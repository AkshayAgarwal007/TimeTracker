TimeTracker
-------------------

TimeTracker is a new program which I wrote because somebody mailed a
request on BeUserTalk, that he would like a program to keep track of the time
he spent on various projects. So I thought: What the heck, I will just code the app for him.
And here it is.

The interface should be self explanatory, if you have any problems with please email
me at: Naish@worldonline.dk

The icon is from Robin Leach's Icon collection, available from BeBits.

Warning: Ocassionaly the app crashes when you quit, I will fix this when I have time, if you can't wait, then the sourcecode is available and you can fix it for yourself.

Have fun
